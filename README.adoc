== What is the problem ?

Sample to demonstrate the problem of reparented JFrames when their parent frame moves: the reparented child frame also moves inside its parent, it does not only follow along. Like if it was moved twice...

It seems like the movement applied depends upon the upper left coordinate of the parent frame.

This problem started in Java 16 and is not present up to Java 15.

This problem is showcased in class `JFrameSampleWithJava16Problem.java`

An alternative implementation in `NoProblem.java` uses a `sun.awt.windows.WEmbeddedFrame` and has no such weird behaviour.

[cols="a,a", frame=none, grid=none]

IMPORTANT: Please tell me where I can report this bug or whether this behavior is expected or not.

== How to run

You need Maven and Java (tested from Java 11 to 21) and run with either of the methods:

--------------------
mvn clean compile exec:java     // will run the class with the problem
--------------------

Try to move the main Frame and on Java16+ you will see the child frame move inside the main Frame.

--------------------
mvn clean compile exec:exec@NoProblem	// will run the sample that has no problem
--------------------

This sample behaves correctly.


== The hack

In `JFrameSampleWithJava16Problem.java`, a boolean `hackForJava16Plus` may be set to true to activate a hack hiding the problem on Java16+
